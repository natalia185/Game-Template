# Pac-man
## Author: Natalia Iwa≈Ñska

### Short description
Pac-man is a very well know arcade game and this project is my version of this game. I decided to recreate this game because I used to play this game as a child and enjoyed a lot. The player's task is to collect as many points as possible, but the enemy ghosts do not sleep and try to prevent the player.
